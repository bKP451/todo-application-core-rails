## Rails Todo Application

Project developed under environment

Ruby 2.7.2

Rails 6.0.6.1

node 14.18.0

yarn 1.22.19

> You can use [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) for switching between different ruby versions

To run the development environment in your system,

`git clone git@github.com:bKP451/todo-application-core-rails.git`

Navigate into the directory

`cd todo-application-core-rails`


Install rails 6.0.6.1 on the directory using

`gem install rails -v 6.0.6.1`

Now, install all the gems using bundle command

`bundle install`

You should have node installed in your system for compiling of
client side JavaScript

`yarn install`



Creating the development database
I am using postgresql as the database

`rails db:migrate:reset`

Next, seeding the database with

`rails db:seed`


Then you can run the todo application application as 
`rails server`

Thanks.

Expecting your suggestions.
